Odin-TODO-List
Technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, JS. Including libraries like Date FNs and technologies like localstorage.
Webpack was used to bundle and ESLint for linting.

This project was very difficult because we had to build the game using modules. I tried to build a scalable project using Factory Functions as opposed to Classes. This was a new way of coding and it took me about 25 hours to get used to coding in this way. I was able to learn how to call and initialize IIFEs and how to properly use factory functions. This project was really fun and I am happy and excited to have learned about these concepts.
